# C++ Full Throttle 
Code repository for my C++20 Full Throttle (Part 1) live training—Part 1 of a two part sequence.

This course is a one-day, presentation-only, code-intensive intro to C++20 core language fundamentals, arrays, strings, vectors, pointers, and object-oriented programming (details at https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/c20-full-throttle-with-paul-deitel/0636920092682/).

Part 2 — C++20 for C++ Programmers Full Throttle — will be a one-day, code-intensive presentation of C++20s "big four" features—Ranges, Concepts, Modules and Coroutines—as well as standard library containers, iterators and algorithms; templates and template metaprogramming; C++20 text formatting; and concurrency.
